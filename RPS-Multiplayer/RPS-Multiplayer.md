# Video Game Trivia

A revamp of the famous Rock, Paper, Scissor Game Part II

## Game Play

Welcome! The game was re-vamped from the original RPS Assignment, and now features firebase to support multiplayer, observer, and chat capabilities. Yes, now the famous RPS game can be enjoyed by 2 players. Visitors can watch the feverish competition and 
comment (or Troll) on the action.

## Wait, What on earth is Janken Pon Dude?!

For first time visitors, did you know that Janken Pon (now called Rock, Paper, Scisscors) and was invented
thousands of years ago in China? Indeed, the game became popular over the millenia until it reached Japan around the
1700's and eventually the rest of Western Civilization. There are serveral variations of the game including one that 
involves a FOURTH selection that results in an automatic loss if an opponent tried to challenge it. 
The God's have decided to spare you such a humiliating defeat, and as such, is not included in this version. Maybe 
in Part III.. (insert sinister laughter here). Enjoy, and good luck!
