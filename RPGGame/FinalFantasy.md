# Final Fantasy RPG Card Game

A jQuery Final Fantasy themed RPG card game.

## Game Play

Welcome! This game was designed applying a simple attack algorithm based on the selected characters 3 main attributes: Health Points (HP), and Attack Power (AP). The rules are simple: Pick a character and try to determine the best line up for your oppents to beat them ALL. Every character chosen should be able to beat all the remaining apponents if selected in the correct order. Note: that the AP were intentionally hidden for discovery. The game features the application of HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, Jquery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sound, and Animation.

## Theme

The game was designed in the theme of Final Fantasy, my FAVORITE sci-fi turn based RPG of all time. The games long and wonderous history started in 1987 under the notion that if this game did not succeed the author would have folded shop ..permanently.. hence the word "Final" in the title Final Fantasy. Thanks to Nintendos (its first platform) aggressive marketing strategy, the game was huge success. From there many installations of the game were born, each iteration being significantly greater, deeper, and more involved than the last. To date over 70+ Final Fantasy games (including spin-offs) have been widely received by RPG players around the world.
