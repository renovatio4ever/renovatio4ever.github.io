                    <p>Welcome! This game was designed applying a simple attack algorithm based on the selected
                        characters 3 main attributes: Health Points (HP), and Attack Power (AP). The rules are simple: Pick a character
                        and try to determine the best line up for your oppents to beat them ALL. Every character chosen should be 
                        able to beat all the remaining apponents if selected in the correct order. Note: that the AP were intentionally
                        hidden for discovery. The game features the application of HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, Jquery, JavaScript, 
                        Bootstrap, Sound, and Animation.</p>

                    <p>The game was designed in the theme of Final Fantasy, my FAVORITE sci-fi turn based RPG of all
                        time. The games long and wonderous history started in 1987 under the notion that if this game
                        did not succeed the author would have folded shop ..permanently.. hence the word "Final" in the
                        title Final Fantasy. Thanks to Nintendos (its first platform) aggressive marketing strategy,
                        the game was huge success. From there many installations of the game were born, each iteration
                        being significantly greater, deeper, and more involved than the last. To date over 70+ Final
                        Fantasy games (including spin-offs) have been widely received by RPG players around the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>This card game is a tribute to the geniuses of Square Enix who continue to dazzle gamers world
                        wide with the never ending story of good, and evil. Children of the light, followers of the
                        Crystal. Enjoy!</p>
