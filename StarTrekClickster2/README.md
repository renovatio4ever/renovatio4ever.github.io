<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This application was built upon the base Clickster project assignment, a web game application where users click images of <em>popular</em> Star Trek Characters in order to earn points.  You win the game whenever you have clicked all 9 of the Star Trek Characters. There is a catch however, the Star Trek characters move in their location with every click... </li>
  <li>The Star Trek Characters are property of Paramout Studios, and is used exclusively for educational purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React.js- UI</li>
  <li>Bootstrap- CSS framework</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Code</h2>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>Create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app Clicky-game in the command line. Next browse into that directory by typing 'cd Clicky-game' in the terminal. Enter yarn start to open the app in the browser.</p>
<h4>Starting to Code</h4>
<p>Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files.  Altered two things in the index.html page: the title the app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. Added MVC source. Bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory.  Three components were leveraged for the application, however, it could have been refactored using spread operators or array components.</p>
<h4>Components</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Card
      <p>The card component is where the Star Trek Characters images are displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Score
    <p>The score component is where the score is displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Wrapper
    <p>The Wrapper component wraps the card component.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A separate header component could have been leveraged but was not due to time constraints. In short, a header component could be used to include scoring details, and additional interactive user components.</p>
