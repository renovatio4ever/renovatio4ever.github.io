## About

This is a simple game based on the classic fantasy football betting game hosted in many places. The premise is that people bet on the score or standing of teams or players. The person who bets the closest to the outcome (like a touch down, pass, run, or fumble..etc..) wins the pot. The pot is determined by the number of individuals and monies accumulated.

The Dream Team Picker Game is a simplified version of the premise and only focuses on bets made on a selected team. The web application encompasses the sum knowledge to date of designing an interactive site that leverages technologies including Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Firebase, Bootstrap, JQuery, and API.

## What are the rules?

The user logs into the game by providing thier name and password. New users are asked to select up to 3 teams to place bets against their wins, losses, or draws using virtual money called "NFL Tokens". An API behind the scenes retrieves the latest and greatest stats for the team and compares it against the bet. If any of the selected items goes up in score, the bet they placed is multiplied against the odds and then added back to the tokens.

(i.e. Fred has 5000 NFL Tokens in the bank. Fred bets 100 (from the 5000 tokens) that Green Bay Packers will lose the next game. The odds are 2:1 to lose. The next day Fred logs into the app. The Green Bay Packers lose the game. Fred wins 200 Tokens. His new NFL Token pot is 5100)
